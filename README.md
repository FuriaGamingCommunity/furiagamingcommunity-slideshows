# Furia Gaming Community - Slideshow
Sets a new type of post, called **slides**, which uses WordPress default post title and post description fields to generate its caption content. They can be set to display inside a provided widget along the plugin, fully managed at the appearance pages in WordPress administration menus, by setting the **slideshow** field.
The *slideshow* field is a custom hierarchical [taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies), that can be found under the *slides* menu. Some of the settings can be set on a per widget basis, while some of them can be arranged at *'Settings > Slides'* on the administration side.
This plugin uses **[FlexSlider 2](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/)** by [WooThemes](https://www.woothemes.com/) to provide the slideshow rendering.
